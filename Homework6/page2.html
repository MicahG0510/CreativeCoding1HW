        <h1>The mad king</h1>
            <p>Heavy lies the crown</p>
            
            <p>His subjects at his feet</p>

            <p>He sits upon the throne</p>

            <p>The one he’ll never reach</p>

            <p>He wishes for approval</p> 
            
            <p>He needs to be the best</p>

            <p>The strongest and the bravest</p>

            <p>Such burdens on his chest</p>

            <p>The world will knock him down</p>

            <p>The crown will bid him up </p>

            <p>He gives all unto his people</p>

            <p>Yet they will give him naught</p>

            <p>The pain, the fear, the misery</p>

            <p>He takes them on so none will see</p>

            <p>His silent cries and hearts unrest</p>

            <p>He packs inside his mangled chest</p>

            <p>There’s light inside his dying eyes</p>

            <p>The brightness of his smile shines</p>

            <ul>
                <p>He gives his all yet all he wants</p>
                <p>Is nothing but a single thanks</p>
            </ul>

            <p>Great pride he took within his toils</p>

            <p>Yet still his name the people soiled</p>

            <p>His mind is taxed his soul grows tired</p>

            <p>Something clicks, his mind expires</p>

            <p>The death of pride is the death of reason</p>

            <p>The king no longer stands their treason</p>

            <p>Yet still they laugh, they mock, they holler</p>

            <p>Their souls are black, their hearts are squalor</p>

            <p>The king lets off a chilling cackle</p>

            <p>He steps down from his throne unshackled</p>

            <p>Their folly grasped a moment late</p>

            <p>A journey to the hells await</p>

            <p>They took for granted all he gave</p> 

            <p>Which lead them to an early grave</p>

            <p>His city burns, the world as well</p>

            <p>A throne is all that’s left to quell</p> 

            <p>A throne of ash he sits upon</p> 

            <p>The weight upon his head is gone</p>
